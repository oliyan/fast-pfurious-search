# Fast & PFurious search
> Fueled by PFGREP

Built to work seamlessly with Code for IBM i, this extension brings blazing-fast IBM i source code search directly into your development environment. Built on top of the ultra-fast PFGREP utility (thanks to [seiden group](https://github.com/SeidenGroup)), this extension provides lightning-quick search capabilities across IBM i libraries with an intuitive, modern interface.

The name "Fast & PF-urious" isn't just a cheeky nod to the [Fast and Furious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_%26_Furious) franchise; it perfectly captures that adrenaline rush when you're blazing through thousands of source members with surgical precision. The "PF" represents Physical Files (because that's what we're actually searching), while the "urious" part captures that satisfying moment when technology finally works the way it should have from day one. Because life's too short for slow searches, and hitting 25 + Shift F1 on PDM won't just cut it.

   You can either,
   1. Follow [this link](https://github.com/SeidenGroup/pfgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to install pfgrep first. 
   
   <br> 

   or
   
   <br> 

   2. Run this in your IBM i terminal
   ```sh
   wget https://github.com/SeidenGroup/pfgrep/releases/download/v0.5.1/pfgrep-0.5.1-0seiden.ibmi7.2.ppc64.rpm && yum install pfgrep-0.5.1-0seiden.ibmi7.2.ppc64.rpm
   ```

3. Verify installation: `which pfgrep`

### Connection Issues
- Ensure Code for IBM i extension is connected
- Check that you have proper authority to the libraries you're searching
- Verify PFGREP has appropriate permissions

## üéØ Tips for Best Results

### **Library Organization**
- Use wildcard patterns to search related libraries efficiently
- Set frequently-used libraries as defaults in settings
- Use descriptive library naming conventions for better wildcard matching

### **Search Strategies** 
- Start with broad searches, then narrow down with specific terms
- Use case-insensitive search for initial exploration
- Enable "Whole Words" when searching for specific procedure names
- Use regex patterns for complex matching scenarios

### **Performance Optimization**
- Limit searches to relevant libraries rather than searching all libraries
- Use "Max Matches" to limit results for very common terms
- Consider using "Fixed String" for literal text searches (faster than regex)
